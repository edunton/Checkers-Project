# MxN Checkers
Final Project for cs520: Principles of Programming Languages

The project aims to create a simple two-player checker game. The game uses functional reactive programming to implement the game and linear types via ATS to enforce the correctness of the game's rendering.

###Project Structure

The code behind the project demonstrates organization into three destinct catogories:

* Canvas Utilities: HTML5 Canvas, MooTools
* Game Logic: BaconJS, FRP
* Correctness enforcement: ATS (Utilizing Linear Types)
